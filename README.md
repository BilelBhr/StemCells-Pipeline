# StemCells-Pipeline

### Project Overview

Our solution focuses on classifying and predicting the differentiation of stem cells using machine learning.



It involves extracting features from time-lapse videos of stem cells, clas sifying them with models like SVM, and clustering with SOTA models and K-means.



To predict how stem cells will differentiate, a specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model was developed. This model converts RNA sequences into amino acids, em beds them, and uses similarity searches to identify potential differentiation paths. The approach offers enhanced accuracy in stem cell classification and differentiation, with ap plications in regenerative medicine.



This work was led in collaboration with Talan Innovation Factory, the R&D Department of Talan Tunisia, in the frame of Talan SummerCamp2024 program which theme was, leveraging technological innovation to empower scientific research in biology.
